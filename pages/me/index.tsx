            I am Swapnadeep Mohapatra. Currently I am studying in class 12th at
            D.A.V. Public School, Chandrasekharpur, Bhubaneswar. Apart from that
            I really love to write code and build awesome stuff.

            I am keen to learn new technologies and I always try to demystify
            tech jargons I come across. So I have curated a newsletter called{" "}

            I owe my continuous learning to the internetâ€™s vast open platform
            and like to give back to the tech community. I am an active
            contributor in many programming communities. I helped organize many
            online events and workshops. I have also spoken in communities like
            DevKode, JavaScript Meetup (Bangalore). I spoke about using GraphQL
            as Frontend Developers. I actively participate in various
            open-source projects, hacktoberfests, etc. to get a hands-on
            experience on programming skills. I have also contributed to OSGeo
            as a part of Google Code-In 2020.

            I like to find out community problems and solve them. Whenever I
            have encountered any problems, I take a logical approach to
            understand and identify the root cause, and come up with the
            solution. In most cases, the solution contains a technology-driven
            approach to solve it. Here are some of the problems I tired to solve
            in the recent past:

            In the year 2020, I interned at a Startup, to build a SaaS product
            connecting startups and Angel investors. Initially, I was part of
            the data platform team where I was responsible for building the
            frontend of the internal tool that was used to view and compare all
            kinds of data. Then I was responsible for developing the Backend and
            Frontend for a Kanban-style list-making application. The frontend
            was built in React and Typescript, the backend was built using Node
            and Typescript and also used to default driver of MongoDB for
            database communication. I was also part of the team that developed
            the front-end of the SAAS product which helps startups to accelerate
            their growth. Those 7 months was a great learning experience to work
            with some smart folks in the startup world. I got to learn a lot
            working in a huge codebase and writing scalable code with all the
            best practices. The Tech Stack that I used were React, Redux,
            NodeJS, MongoDB, SaaS. I also integrated a Chat Bot in the app.

            As mentioned before, I have spoken in one of the biggest tech
            communities in India. I talked about Getting Started with GraphQL,
            which covered various topics such as what is GraphQL, what is Query,
            Mutation, and Subscription, how it works with React and Apollo,
            testing GraphQL APIs. Speaking in front of 150+ folks from the tech
            community was a learning experience that helped my boost my
            confidence in public speaking. The talk was followed by a QnA
            session, where I got a chance to chat with some of the best minds in
            the industry and answer their queries. As mentioned before I have

            Coming to my academics, I believe i have done fairly well, if not
            the best. I am not a book worm but I love to read tech related
            books, and many others in the non-fiction genre. I ensure that my
            interests and hobbies do not affect my academics, and I managed to
            bag 94.4% in my 10th board which was among the top 10% of the entire
            batch. I have won many Olympiads too.

            I also keep a keen interest in various finance topics. I actively
            track stocks and other assets, and invest in them from time to time.
            I took up some finance courses through Varsity that helped me
            understand the market better and make the right investment

            . This interest in finance came during my 7-month internship at the
            startup, when i received my first stipend. Instead of spending this
            money unnecessarily, i decided to invest it that could help me in my
            future goals. During my free time, I also take a look at the
            financials of the companies I am invested in, to understand their
            future growth plans and vision, broadly in the areas of
            sustainability and innovations.
